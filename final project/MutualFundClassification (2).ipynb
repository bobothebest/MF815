In addition to the fees and expenses described below, your broker may also require you to pay brokerage commissions on purchases and sales of certain share classes of the fund.\\n\\nYou may qualify for sales charge discounts if you and your family invest, or agree to invest in the future, at least $50,000 in the fund or certain other Fidelity\\u00ae funds. More information about these and other discounts is available from your investment professional and in the \\\"Fund Distribution\\\" section beginning on page 50 of the prospectus. Different intermediaries may provide additional waivers or reductions of the sales charge. Please see \\u201cSales Charge Waiver Policies Applied by Certain Intermediaries\\u201d in the \\u201cAppendix\\u201d section of the prospectus.\\n\\nShareholder fees\\n\\n(fees paid directly from your investment)\\n\\n \\tClass A \\tClass I \\nMaximum sales charge (load) on purchases (as a % of offering price) \\t2.75% \\tNone \\nMaximum contingent deferred sales charge (as a % of the lesser of original purchase price or redemption proceeds) \\tNone(a) \\tNone \\n(a)  Purchases of $250,000 or more will not be subject to a front-end sales charge, but may be subject to a 0.50% contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) if the intermediary firm has elected an upfront finder's fee at the time the shares are purchased, or a 0.75% CDSC if the shares purchased are recordkept in a Fidelity Advisor\\u00ae 401(k) Retirement Plan.\\n\\nAnnual Operating Expenses\\n\\n(expenses that you pay each year as a % of the value of your investment)\\n\\n \\tClass A \\tClass I \\nManagement fee \\t0.30% \\t0.30% \\nDistribution and/or Service (12b-1) fees \\t0.25% \\tNone \\nOther expenses \\t0.10% \\t0.10% \\nTotal annual operating expenses \\t0.65% \\t0.40% \\nThis example helps compare the cost of investing in the fund with the cost of investing in other funds.\\n\\nLet's say, hypothetically, that the annual return for shares of the fund is 5% and that your shareholder fees and the annual operating expenses for shares of the fund are exactly as described in the fee table. This example illustrates the effect of fees and expenses, but is not meant to suggest actual or expected fees and expenses or returns, all of which may vary. For every $10,000 you invested, here's how much you would pay in total expenses if you sell all of your shares at the end of each time period indicated:\\n\\n \\tClass A \\tClass I \\n1 year \\t$340 \\t$41 \\n3 years \\t$477 \\t$128 \\n5 years \\t$627 \\t$224 \\n10 years \\t$1,063 \\t$505 \\nPortfolio Turnover\\n\\nThe fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or \\\"turns over\\\" its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual operating expenses or in the example, affect the fund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the fund's portfolio turnover rate was 8% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\\n\\nNormally investing at least 80% of assets in investment-grade municipal securities whose interest is exempt from federal income tax (but may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax).\\nManaging the fund to have similar overall interest rate risk compared to a customized municipal bond index representing Fidelity Management & Research Company (FMR)'s view of the performance of the fund\\u2019s competitive universe.\\nAllocating assets across different market sectors and maturities.\\nPotentially investing more than 25% of total assets in municipal securities that finance similar types of projects.\\nAnalyzing the credit quality of the issuer, security-specific features, current and potential future valuation, and trading opportunities to select investments.\\nLiquidating shortly after the fund's target end-date of June 30, 2021.\\nPrincipal Investment Risks\\n\\nMunicipal Market Volatility.  The municipal market is volatile and can be significantly affected by adverse tax, legislative, or political changes and the financial condition of the issuers of municipal securities.\\nInterest Rate Changes.  Interest rate increases can cause the price of a debt security to decrease.\\nIssuer-Specific Changes.  The value of an individual security or particular type of security can be more volatile than, and can perform differently from, the market as a whole. A decline in the credit quality of an issuer or a provider of credit support or a maturity-shortening structure for a security can cause the price of a security to decrease.\\nDeclining Yield Risk.  As the fund approaches its liquidation date, the fund's securities will mature and the fund may reinvest the proceeds in money market securities with lower yields than the securities previously held by the fund.\\nFluctuation of Yield & Liquidation Amount Risk.  The amount of the fund's income distributions will vary over time, and the breakdown of returns between fund distributions and liquidation proceeds will not be predictable at the time of your investment, and you may experience a gain or loss for tax purposes.\\nAn investment in the fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Unlike individual debt securities, which typically pay principal at maturity, the value of an investment in the fund will fluctuate. You could lose money by investing in the fund.\\n\\nPerformance\\n\\nThe following information is intended to help you understand the risks of investing in the fund. The information illustrates the changes in the performance of the fund's shares from year to year and compares the performance of the fund's shares to the performance of a securities market index and an additional index over various periods of time. The indexes have characteristics relevant to the fund's investment strategies. Index descriptions appear in the \\\"Additional Index Information\\\" section of the prospectus. Past performance (before and after taxes) is not an indication of future performance.\\n\\nVisit institutional.fidelity.com for more recent performance information.\\n\\nYear-by-Year Returns\\n\\nThe returns in the bar chart do not reflect any applicable sales charges; if sales charges were reflected, returns would be lower than those shown.\\n\\n\\n\\nDuring the periods shown in the chart for Class A: \\tReturns \\tQuarter ended \\nHighest Quarter Return \\t2.53% \\tJune 30, 2014 \\nLowest Quarter Return \\t(3.73)% \\tJune 30, 2013 \\nYear-to-Date Return \\t0.32% \\tJune 30, 2018 \\nAverage Annual Returns\\n\\nUnlike the returns in the bar chart, the returns in the table reflect the maximum applicable sales charges. After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates, but do not reflect the impact of state or local taxes.

Ask your investment professional or visit your intermediary's web site for more information.\",\n          \"American Funds College 2036 Fund\\n\\nInvestment objectives The fund will seek to achieve the following objectives to varying degrees: growth, income and preservation of capital, depending on the proximity to its target date. The target date is meant to roughly correspond to the year in which the fund beneficiary will start to withdraw funds to meet higher education expenses. The fund will increasingly emphasize income and preservation of capital by investing a greater portion of its assets in bond, equity-income and balanced funds as it approaches and passes its target date. In this way, the fund seeks to achieve an appropriate balance of total return and stability during different time periods.\\n\\nFees and expenses of the fund This table describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold shares of the fund. You may qualify for a Class 529-A sales charge discount if you and your family invest, or agree to invest in the future, at least $100,000 in American Funds.

The example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the fund\\u2019s operating expenses remain the same. The example reflects the expense reimbursement described above through the expiration date of such reimbursement and total annual fund operating expenses thereafter. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\\n\\n \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\nShare class:\\t529-A\\t529-C\\t529-E\\t529-T\\t529-F-1\\tFor the share class listed to the right, you would pay the following if you did not redeem your shares:\\tShare class:\\t529-C\\n1 year\\t$ 514\\t$ 263\\t$ 110\\t$ 345\\t$ 61\\t1 year\\t$ 163\\n3 years\\t707\\t509\\t348\\t549\\t197\\t3 years\\t509\\n5 years\\t916\\t879\\t604\\t771\\t344\\t5 years\\t879\\n10 years\\t1,518\\t1,920\\t1,338\\t1,408\\t772\\t10 years\\t1,920\\nPortfolio turnover The fund may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or \\u201cturns over\\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the fund\\u2019s investment results. During the most recent fiscal year, the fund's portfolio turnover rate was less than 1% of the average value of its portfolio or there was no turnover.\\n\\nPrincipal investment strategies The fund will attempt to achieve its investment objectives by investing in a mix of American Funds in different combinations and weightings. The underlying American Funds represent a variety of fund categories such as growth funds, growth-and-income funds, equity-income funds, balanced funds and bond funds. The fund categories represent differing investment objectives. For example, growth funds seek long-term growth primarily through investing in both U.S. stocks and stocks of issuers domiciled outside the U.S. Growth-and-income funds seek long-term growth-and-income primarily through investments in stocks. Equity-income and balanced funds generally strive for income and growth through stocks and/or bond investments, while bond funds seek current income through bond investments. The fund is designed for investors who plan to attend college in, or close to, the year designated in the fund\\u2019s name.\\n\\nThe investment adviser may periodically rebalance or modify the asset mix of the funds and change the underlying fund investments. According to its current investment approach, the percentage of the fund invested in different categories will change until the fund reaches its target date. Upon reaching its target date, the fund will be principally invested in fixed-income funds and may merge into the Enrollment Fund, which will also be principally invested in fixed-income funds.\\n\\nThe fund\\u2019s investment adviser periodically reviews the investment strategies and asset mix of the underlying funds. The investment adviser will also consider whether overall market conditions would favor a change in the exposure of the fund to various asset types or geographic regions. Based on these considerations, the investment adviser may make adjustments to underlying fund holdings by adjusting the percentage of individual underlying funds within the fund, or adding or removing underlying funds. The investment adviser may also determine not to change the underlying fund allocations, particularly in response to short-term market movements, if in its opinion the combination of underlying funds is appropriate to meet the fund\\u2019s investment objective.\\n\\nWith respect to its fixed-income investments, the underlying funds in which the fund invests may hold debt securities with a wide range of quality and maturities. The fund may invest in underlying funds with significant exposure to bonds rated BB+ or below and Ba1 or below by Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations designated by the fund\\u2019s investment adviser, or unrated but determined by the fund\\u2019s investment adviser to be of equivalent quality. Securities rated BB+ or below and Ba1 or below are sometimes referred to as \\u201cjunk bonds.\\u201d Exposure to lower rated securities may help the fund achieve its objective of providing current income.\\n\\nThe underlying funds may hold securities issued and guaranteed by the U.S. government, securities issued by federal agencies and instrumentalities and securities backed by mortgages or other assets. The underlying funds may also invest in the debt securities of governments, agencies, corporations and other entities domiciled outside the United States.\\n\\nAmerican Funds College Target Date Series / Prospectus     2\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nThe following chart illustrates the investment approach of the fund by showing how its investment in the various fund categories will change over time. The allocations shown reflect the fund\\u2019s target allocations as of January 1, 2019.\\n\\nInvestment approach\\n\\n\\n\\nThe investment adviser anticipates that the fund will invest its assets within a range that deviates no more than 10% above or below the investment approach set forth above. For example, a 20% target allocation to growth funds is not expected to be greater than 30% or less than 10%. The investment adviser will continuously monitor the fund and may make modifications to either the investment approach or the underlying fund allocations that the investment adviser believes could benefit shareholders.\\n\\n3     American Funds College Target Date Series / Prospectus\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nPrincipal risks This section describes the principal risks associated with investing in the fund and its underlying funds. You may lose money by investing in the fund. The likelihood of loss may be greater if you invest for a shorter period of time. Investors in the fund should have a long-term perspective and be able to tolerate potentially sharp declines in value.\\n\\nThe following are principal risks associated with the fund\\u2019s investment strategies.\\n\\nAllocation risk \\u2014 Investments in the fund are subject to risks related to the investment adviser\\u2019s allocation choices. The selection of the underlying funds and the allocation of the fund\\u2019s assets could cause the fund to lose value or its results to lag relevant benchmarks or other funds with similar objectives.\\n\\nFund structure \\u2014 The fund invests in underlying funds and incurs expenses related to the underlying funds. In addition, investors in the fund will incur fees to pay for certain expenses related to the operations of the fund. An investor holding the underlying funds directly and in the same proportions as the fund would incur lower overall expenses but would not receive the benefit of the portfolio management and other services provided by the fund.\\n\\nUnderlying fund risks \\u2014 Because the fund\\u2019s investments consist of underlying funds, the fund\\u2019s risks are directly related to the risks of the underlying funds. For this reason, it is important to understand the risks associated with investing in the underlying funds, as described below.\\n\\nThe following are principal risks associated with the underlying funds\\u2019 investment strategies.\\n\\nMarket conditions \\u2014 The prices of, and the income generated by, the common stocks, bonds and other securities held by the underlying funds may decline \\u2013 sometimes rapidly or unpredictably \\u2013 due to various factors, including events or conditions affecting the general economy or particular industries; overall market changes; local, regional or global political, social or economic instability; governmental, governmental agency or central bank responses to economic conditions; and currency exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price fluctuations.\\n\\nIssuer risks \\u2014 The prices of, and the income generated by, securities held by the underlying funds may decline in response to various factors directly related to the issuers of such securities, including reduced demand for an issuer\\u2019s goods or services, poor management performance, major litigation against the issuer, changes in government regulations affecting the issuer or its competitive environment and strategic initiatives such as mergers, acquisitions or dispositions and the market response to any such initiatives.\\n\\nInvesting in stocks \\u2014 Investing in stocks may involve larger price swings and greater potential for loss than other types of investments. As a result, the value of the underlying funds may be subject to sharp, short-term declines in value. Income provided by an underlying fund may be reduced by changes in the dividend policies of, and the capital resources available at, the companies in which the underlying fund invests. As the fund nears its target date, a decreasing proportion of the fund\\u2019s assets will be invested in underlying funds that invest primarily in stocks. Accordingly, these risks are expected to be more significant the further the fund is removed from its target date and are expected to lessen as the fund approaches its target date.\\n\\nInvesting in debt instruments \\u2014 The prices of, and the income generated by, bonds and other debt securities held by an underlying fund may be affected by changing interest rates and by changes in the effective maturities and credit ratings of these securities.\\n\\nRising interest rates will generally cause the prices of bonds and other debt securities to fall. A general rise in interest rates may cause investors to sell debt securities on a large scale, which could also adversely affect the price and liquidity of debt securities and could also result in increased redemptions from the fund. Falling interest rates may cause an issuer to redeem, call or refinance a debt security before its stated maturity, which may result in the fund failing to recoup the full amount of its initial investment and having to reinvest the proceeds in lower yielding securities. Longer maturity debt securities generally have greater sensitivity to changes in interest rates and may be subject to greater price fluctuations than shorter maturity debt securities.\\n\\nBonds and other debt securities are also subject to credit risk, which is the possibility that the credit strength of an issuer or guarantor will weaken or be perceived to be weaker, and/or an issuer of a debt security will fail to make timely payments of principal or interest and the security will go into default. A downgrade or default affecting any of the underlying funds\\u2019 securities could cause the value of the underlying funds\\u2019 shares to decrease. Credit risk is gauged, in part, by the credit ratings of the debt securities in which the underlying fund invests. However, ratings are only the opinions of the rating agencies issuing them and are not guarantees as to credit quality or an evaluation of market risk. The underlying funds\\u2019 investment adviser relies on its own credit analysts to research issuers and issues in seeking to assess credit and default risks. These risks will be more significant as the fund approaches its target date because a greater proportion of the fund\\u2019s assets will consist of underlying funds that primarily invest in bonds.\\n\\nAmerican Funds College Target Date Series / Prospectus     4\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nInvesting in lower rated debt instruments \\u2014 Lower rated bonds and other lower rated debt securities generally have higher rates of interest and involve greater risk of default or price declines due to changes in the issuer\\u2019s creditworthiness than those of higher quality debt securities. The market prices of these securities may fluctuate more than the prices of higher quality debt securities and may decline significantly in periods of general economic difficulty. These risks may be increased with respect to investments in junk bonds.\\n\\nInvesting in small companies \\u2014 Investing in smaller companies may pose additional risks. For example, it is often more difficult to value or dispose of small company stocks and more difficult to obtain information about smaller companies than about larger companies. Furthermore, smaller companies often have limited product lines, operating histories, markets and/or financial resources, may be dependent on one or a few key persons for management, and can be more susceptible to losses. Moreover, the prices of their stocks may be more volatile than stocks of larger, more established companies, particularly during times of market turmoil.\\n\\nInvesting outside the United States \\u2014 Securities of issuers domiciled outside the United States, or with significant operations or revenues outside the United States, may lose value because of adverse political, social, economic or market developments (including social instability, regional conflicts, terrorism and war) in the countries or regions in which the issuers operate or generate revenue. These securities may also lose value due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar and/or currencies of other countries. Issuers of these securities may be more susceptible to actions of foreign governments, such as nationalization, currency blockage or the imposition of price controls or punitive taxes, each of which could adversely impact the value of these securities. Securities markets in certain countries may be more volatile and/or less liquid than those in the United States. Investments outside the United States may also be subject to different accounting practices and different regulatory, legal and reporting standards and practices, and may be more difficult to value, than those in the United States. In addition, the value of investments outside the United States may be reduced by foreign taxes, including foreign withholding taxes on interest and dividends. Further, there may be increased risks of delayed settlement of securities purchased or sold by an underlying fund. The risks of investing outside the United States may be heightened in connection with investments in emerging markets.\\n\\nInvesting in emerging markets \\u2014 Investing in emerging markets may involve risks in addition to and greater than those generally associated with investing in the securities markets of developed countries. For instance, emerging market countries may have less developed legal and accounting systems than those in developed countries. The governments of these countries may be less stable and more likely to impose capital controls, nationalize a company or industry, place restrictions on foreign ownership and on withdrawing sale proceeds of securities from the country, and/or impose punitive taxes that could adversely affect the prices of securities. In addition, the economies of these countries may be dependent on relatively few industries that are more susceptible to local and global changes. Securities markets in these countries can also be relatively small and have substantially lower trading volumes. As a result, securities issued in these countries may be more volatile and less liquid, and may be more difficult to value, than securities issued in countries with more developed economies and/or markets. Less certainty with respect to security valuations may lead to additional challenges and risks in calculating the underlying fund\\u2019s net asset value. Additionally, emerging markets are more likely to experience problems with the clearing and settling of trades and the holding of securities by banks, agents and depositories that are less established than those in developed countries.\\n\\nInvesting in derivatives \\u2014 The use of derivatives involves a variety of risks, which may be different from, or greater than, the risks associated with investing in traditional securities, such as stocks and bonds. Changes in the value of a derivative may not correlate perfectly with, and may be more sensitive to market events than, the underlying asset, rate or index, and a derivative instrument may expose the underlying fund to losses in excess of its initial investment. Derivatives may be difficult to value, difficult for the underlying fund to buy or sell at an opportune time or price and difficult to terminate or otherwise offset. The underlying fund\\u2019s use of derivatives may result in losses to the underlying fund, and investing in derivatives may reduce the underlying fund\\u2019s returns and increase the underlying fund\\u2019s price volatility. The underlying fund\\u2019s counterparty to a derivative transaction (including, if applicable, the underlying fund\\u2019s clearing broker, the derivatives exchange or the clearinghouse) may be unable or unwilling to honor its financial obligations in respect of the transaction.\\n\\nManagement \\u2014 The investment adviser to the fund and to the underlying funds actively manages each underlying fund\\u2019s investments. Consequently, the underlying funds are subject to the risk that the methods and analyses, including models, tools and data, employed by the investment adviser in this process may be flawed or incorrect and may not produce the desired results. This could cause an underlying fund to lose value or its investment results to lag relevant benchmarks or other funds with similar objectives.\\n\\nYour investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency, entity or person. You should consider how this fund fits into your overall investment program.\\n\\n5     American Funds College Target Date Series / Prospectus\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nInvestment results Because the fund began investment operations on February 9, 2018, information regarding investment results for a full calendar year is not available as of the date of this prospectus.\\n\\nAmerican Funds College Target Date Series / Prospectus     6\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nManagement\\n\\nInvestment adviser Capital Research and Management CompanySM\\n\\nPortfolio oversight committee The investment adviser\\u2019s Portfolio Oversight Committee develops the allocation approach and selects the underlying funds in which the fund invests.

A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund\\u2019s performance. The portfolio turnover rate of Henderson International Opportunities Fund (the \\u201cPredecessor Fund\\u201d) and the Fund for the fiscal year August 1, 2016 to July 31, 2017 was 51% of the average value of the portfolio. The portfolio turnover rate of the Fund for the fiscal period August 1, 2017 to September 30, 2017 was 5% of the average value of the portfolio.\\nPRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGIES\\nThe Fund pursues its investment objective by investing, under normal circumstances, at least 40% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in equity securities of non-U.S. companies and in at least three different countries. Equity securities include common stocks and related securities, such as preferred stock, convertible securities, and depositary receipts. Non-U.S. companies include companies in emerging market countries and are broadly defined to include any company that meets one of the following tests: (i) its country of organization, its primary business office and/or the principal trading market of its stock are located outside of the U.S., (ii) 50% or more of its assets are located in a country other than the U.S., or (iii) 50% or more of its revenues are derived from outside of the U.S.\\nFund investment performance will be derived primarily from stock selection. A strategic asset allocation process will be a secondary contributor to the investment process. Security selection may be based upon an analysis of a company\\u2019s valuations relative to earnings forecasts or other valuation criteria, earnings growth prospects of a company, the quality of a company\\u2019s management and the unique competitive advantages of a company. Asset allocation will be reviewed regularly based upon strategic views related to the growth prospects, valuations and pricing associated with international equity regions. Assets of the Fund are allocated to teams of portfolio managers who have experience with respect to a particular geographic region or discipline.\\nThe Fund generally sells a stock when, in the portfolio managers\\u2019 opinions, there is a deterioration in the company\\u2019s fundamentals, the company fails to meet performance expectations, the stock achieves its target price, its earnings are disappointing or its revenue growth has slowed. The Fund may also sell a stock if the portfolio managers believe that negative country or regional factors may affect the company\\u2019s outlook, in the portfolio managers\\u2019 opinion, a superior investment opportunity arises or to meet cash requirements. The portfolio managers anticipate that the Fund will continue to hold securities of companies that grow or expand so long as the portfolio managers believe the securities continue to offer prospects of long-term growth. Some of the Fund\\u2019s investments may produce income, although income from dividends and interest will be incidental and not an important consideration in choosing investments.\\n77\\u2002\\tJanus Henderson International Opportunities Fund\\n \\n\\nThe Fund may, under unusual circumstances, invest in a single country or a limited number of countries. In addition, the Fund may invest in securities issued by smaller companies and in less seasoned issuers, including through initial public offerings and private placements.\\nThe Fund may invest its assets in derivatives, which are instruments that have a value derived from, or directly linked to, an underlying asset, such as equity securities, commodities, or currencies, as substitutes for securities in which the Fund invests. In particular, the Fund may invest in derivatives such as forward currency contracts to offset risks associated with currency exposure.\\nThe Fund may engage in active and frequent trading to achieve its investment objective. The Fund does not limit its investments to companies of any particular size and may invest a significant portion of its assets in smaller and less seasoned issuers. However, in an attempt to reduce portfolio risks, the portfolio managers generally will invest across countries, industry groups and/or sectors.\\nThe Fund may lend portfolio securities on a short-term or long-term basis, in an amount equal to up to one-third of its total assets as determined at the time of the loan origination.\\nPRINCIPAL INVESTMENT RISKS\\nThe biggest risk is that the Fund\\u2019s returns will vary, and you could lose money. The Fund is designed for long-term investors seeking a global equity portfolio, including common stocks. Common stocks tend to be more volatile than many other investment choices.\\nForeign Exposure Risk.  The Fund normally has significant exposure to foreign markets as a result of its investments in foreign securities and derivatives that provide exposure to foreign markets, including investments in emerging markets, which can be more volatile than the U.S. markets. As a result, its returns and net asset value may be affected to a large degree by fluctuations in currency exchange rates or political or economic conditions in a particular country. In some foreign markets, there may not be protection against failure by other parties to complete transactions. It may not be possible for the Fund to repatriate capital, dividends, interest, and other income from a particular country or governmental entity. In addition, a market swing in one or more countries or regions where the Fund has invested a significant amount of its assets may have a greater effect on the Fund\\u2019s performance than it would in a more geographically diversified portfolio. To the extent the Fund invests in foreign debt securities, such investments are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Additionally, investments in securities of foreign governments involve the risk that a foreign government may not be willing or able to pay interest or repay principal when due. The Fund\\u2019s investments in emerging market countries may involve risks greater than, or in addition to, the risks of investing in more developed countries.\\nEmerging Markets Risk.  The risks of foreign investing mentioned above are heightened when investing in emerging markets. Emerging markets securities involve a number of additional risks, which may result from less government supervision and regulation of business and industry practices (including the potential lack of strict finance and accounting controls and standards), stock exchanges, brokers, and listed companies, making these investments potentially more volatile in price and less liquid than investments in developed securities markets, resulting in greater risk to investors. There is a risk in developing countries that a future economic or political crisis could lead to price controls, forced mergers of companies, expropriation or confiscatory taxation, imposition or enforcement of foreign ownership limits, seizure, nationalization, sanctions or imposition of restrictions by various governmental entities on investment and trading, or creation of government monopolies, any of which may have a detrimental effect on the Fund\\u2019s investments. In addition, the Fund\\u2019s investments may be denominated in foreign currencies and therefore, changes in the value of a country\\u2019s currency compared to the U.S. dollar may affect the value of the Fund\\u2019s investments. To the extent that the Fund invests a significant portion of its assets in the securities of issuers in or companies of a single country or region, it is more likely to be impacted by events or conditions affecting that country or region, which could have a negative impact on the Fund\\u2019s performance. Some of the risks of investing directly in foreign and emerging market securities may be reduced when the Fund invests indirectly in foreign securities through various other investment vehicles including derivatives, which also involve other risks. As of September 30, 2017, approximately 17.7% of the Fund\\u2019s investments were in emerging markets (i.e. countries included in the MSCI Emerging Markets Indexsm).\\nSector Risk.  At times, the Fund may have a significant portion of its assets invested in securities of companies conducting business within an economic sector. Companies in the same economic sector may be similarly affected by economic or market events, making the Fund more vulnerable to unfavorable developments in that economic sector than funds that invest\\n78\\u2002\\tJanus Henderson International Opportunities Fund\\n \\n\\nmore broadly. As the Fund\\u2019s portfolio becomes more concentrated, the Fund is less able to spread risk and potentially reduce the risk of loss and volatility.\\nGeographic Concentration Risk.  To the extent the Fund invests a substantial amount of its assets in issuers located in a single country or region, the economic, political, regulatory or other developments or conditions within such country or region will generally have a greater effect on the Fund than they would on a more geographically diversified fund, which may result in greater losses and volatility.\\nMarket Risk.  The value of the Fund\\u2019s portfolio may decrease if the value of an individual company or security, or multiple companies or securities, in the portfolio decreases or if the portfolio managers\\u2019 belief about a company\\u2019s intrinsic worth is incorrect. Further, regardless of how well individual companies or securities perform, the value of the Fund\\u2019s portfolio could also decrease if there are deteriorating economic or market conditions. It is important to understand that the value of your investment may fall, sometimes sharply, in response to changes in the market, and you could lose money. Market risk may affect a single issuer, industry, economic sector, or the market as a whole.\\nSmall- and Mid-Sized Companies Risk.  The Fund\\u2019s investments in securities issued by small- and mid-sized companies, which can include smaller, start-up companies offering emerging products or services, may involve greater risks than are customarily associated with larger, more established companies. For example, while small- and mid-sized companies may realize more substantial growth than larger or more established issuers, they may also suffer more significant losses as a result of their narrow product lines, limited operating history, greater exposure to competitive threats, limited financial resources, limited trading markets, and the potential lack of management depth. Securities issued by small- and mid-sized companies tend to be more volatile and somewhat more speculative than securities issued by larger or more established companies and may underperform as compared to the securities of larger or more established companies. These holdings are also subject to wider price fluctuations and tend to be less liquid than stocks of larger or more established companies, which could have a significant adverse effect on the Fund\\u2019s returns, especially as market conditions change.\\nInitial Public Offering Risk.  The Fund\\u2019s purchase of shares issued in an initial public offering (\\u201cIPO\\u201d) exposes it to the risks associated with companies that have little operating history as public companies, as well as to the risks inherent in those sectors of the market where these new issuers operate. Although IPO investments may have had a positive impact on the Fund\\u2019s performance in the past, there can be no assurance that the Fund will identify favorable IPO investment opportunities in the future. In addition, as the Fund increases in size, the impact of IPOs on the Fund\\u2019s performance will generally decrease.\\nDerivatives Risk.  Derivatives can be highly volatile and involve risks in addition to the risks of the underlying referenced securities or asset. Gains or losses from a derivative investment can be substantially greater than the derivative\\u2019s original cost, and can therefore involve leverage. Leverage may cause the Fund to be more volatile than if it had not used leverage. Derivatives can be less liquid than other types of investments and entail the risk that the counterparty will default on its payment obligations. The Fund may use derivatives, including forward currency contracts, for hedging purposes. Hedging with derivatives may increase expenses, and there is no guarantee that a hedging strategy will work. While hedging can reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains or cause losses if the market moves in a manner different from that anticipated by the Fund or if the cost of the derivative outweighs the benefit of the hedge.\\nPortfolio Turnover Risk.  Increased portfolio turnover may result in higher costs, which may have a negative effect on the Fund\\u2019s performance. In addition, higher portfolio turnover may result in the acceleration of capital gains and the recognition of greater levels of short-term capital gains, which are taxed at ordinary federal income tax rates when distributed to shareholders.\\nSecurities Lending Risk.  The Fund may seek to earn additional income through lending its securities to certain qualified broker-dealers and institutions. There is the risk that when portfolio securities are lent, the securities may not be returned on a timely basis, and the Fund may experience delays and costs in recovering the security or gaining access to the collateral provided to the Fund to collateralize the loan. If the Fund is unable to recover a security on loan, the Fund may use the collateral to purchase replacement securities in the market. There is a risk that the value of the collateral could decrease below the cost of the replacement security by the time the replacement investment is made, resulting in a loss to the Fund.\\nManagement Risk.  The Fund is an actively managed investment portfolio and is therefore subject to the risk that the investment strategies employed for the Fund may fail to produce the intended results. The Fund may underperform its benchmark index or other mutual funds with similar investment objectives.\\n79\\u2002\\tJanus Henderson International Opportunities Fund\\n \\n\\nAn investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.\\nPERFORMANCE INFORMATION\\nThe following information provides some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by showing how the Fund\\u2019s performance has varied over time. Returns shown prior to June 5, 2017 are those of the Predecessor Fund, Henderson International Opportunities Fund. The Predecessor Fund was advised by Henderson Global Investors (North America) Inc. and subadvised by Henderson Investment Management Limited. Class A Shares, Class C Shares, Class R Shares, Class I Shares, Class IF Shares and Class R6 Shares of the Predecessor Fund were reorganized into Class A Shares, Class C Shares, Class R Shares, Class I Shares (Class I Shares and Class IF Shares of the Predecessor Fund were reorganized into Class I Shares of the Fund) and Class N Shares, respectively, of the Fund on June 2, 2017.

You may also incur usual and customary brokerage commissions when buying or selling shares of the fund, which are not reflected in the example that follows.\\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment)\\nManagement Fee\\n0.29%\\nOther Expenses1\\n0.00%\\nTotal Annual Fund Operating Expenses\\n0.29%\\n1Other expenses are based on estimated amounts for the current fiscal year.\\nExample\\nThe example below is intended to help you compare the costs of investing in the fund with the costs of investing in other funds. The example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods, that you earn a 5% return each year, and that the fund\\u2019s operating expenses remain the same. You may be required to pay brokerage commissions on your purchases of shares of the fund which are not reflected in the example. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\\n1 year\\n3 years\\n$30\\n$93\\nPortfolio Turnover\\nThe fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or \\u201cturns over\\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the fund\\u2019s performance. Because the fund is new, the fund\\u2019s portfolio turnover rate is not available.\\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\\nThe fund invests in municipal and other debt securities. Under normal market conditions, the portfolio managers invest at least 80% of the fund\\u2019s net assets, plus borrowings for investment purposes, in municipal securities with interest payments exempt from federal income tax. Some of these investments in municipal securities are not necessarily exempt from the federal alternative minimum tax.\\nThe fund principally invests in investment-grade debt securities but may invest in high-yield securities (junk bonds). A high-yield security is one that has been rated below investment-grade or determined by the investment advisor to be of similar quality, including bonds that are in technical or monetary default. Issuers of these securities often have short financial histories or have questionable credit or have had and may continue to have problems making interest and principal payments. The portfolio managers also may buy unrated securities if they determine such securities meet the investment objective of the fund.\\nThe fund may purchase debt securities of any duration, and the average duration of the fund will vary based on the portfolio managers\\u2019 forecast of interest rates.\\nAlthough the fund seeks current income, it also employs techniques designed to realize capital appreciation. For example, the portfolio managers may select bonds with maturities and coupon rates that position the fund for potential capital appreciation for a variety of reasons, including their view on the direction of future interest-rate movements and the potential for a credit upgrade.\\nThe fund is an actively managed exchange-traded fund (ETF) that does not seek to replicate the performance of a specified index. When determining whether to buy or sell a security, portfolio managers consider, among other things, current and anticipated changes in interest rates, the credit quality of a particular issuer, comparable alternatives, general market conditions and any other factor deemed relevant by the portfolio managers.\\nPrincipal Risks\\n\\u2022\\nCredit Risk  - Debt securities, even investment-grade debt securities, are subject to credit risk. The risk that the inability or perceived inability of a security\\u2019s issuer to make interest and principal payments may cause the value of the security to decrease. As a result, the fund\\u2019s share price could also decrease. Changes in the credit rating of a debt security held by the fund could have a similar effect. The fund\\u2019s investments may have high credit risk, which helps the fund pursue a higher yield than more conservatively managed bond funds.\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\nBelow Investment-Grade Securities Risk - Issuers of lower rated, high-yield securities are more vulnerable to real or perceived economic changes (such as an economic downturn or a prolonged period of rising interest rates), political changes, or adverse developments specific to the issuer. Adverse economic, political and other developments may be more likely to cause an issuer of low-quality bonds to default on its obligation to pay interest and principal due under its securities. The fund may invest in securities rated below investment-grade or that are unrated, including bonds that are in technical or monetary default. By definition, the issuers of many of these securities have had and may continue to have problems making interest and principal payments.\\n\\u2022\\nInterest Rate Risk  - When interest rates change, the fund\\u2019s share value will be affected. Generally, the value of debt securities and the funds that hold them decline as interest rates rise. Because the fund may invest in intermediate-term and long-term bonds, the fund\\u2019s interest rate risk is generally higher than for funds with shorter-weighted average maturities, such as money market and short-term bond funds. A period of rising interest rates may negatively affect the fund\\u2019s performance.\\n\\u2022\\nMunicipal Securities Risk  - Because the fund invests principally in municipal securities, it will be sensitive to events that affect municipal markets, including legislative or political changes and the financial condition of the issuers of municipal securities. The fund may have a higher level of risk than funds that invest in a larger universe of securities.\\n\\u2022\\nCash Transactions Risk - The fund may effect its creations and redemptions for cash, rather than for in-kind securities. Therefore, it may be required to sell portfolio securities and subsequently recognize gains on such sales that the fund might not have recognized if it were to distribute portfolio securities in-kind. As such, investments in fund shares may be less tax-efficient than an investment in an ETF that distributes portfolio securities entirely in-kind.\\n\\u2022\\nTax Risk  - Some or all of the fund\\u2019s income may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax. There is no guarantee that all of the fund\\u2019s income will remain exempt from federal or state income taxes. Income from municipal bonds held by a fund could be declared taxable because of unfavorable changes in tax laws, adverse interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service or state tax authorities, or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer. The fund may sell securities that lose their tax-exempt statuses at inopportune times, which may cause tax consequences or a decrease in the fund\\u2019s value.\\n\\u2022\\nLiquidity Risk  - During periods of market turbulence or unusually low trading activity, to meet redemptions, it may be necessary for the fund to sell securities at prices that could have an adverse effect on the fund\\u2019s share price. Changing regulatory and market conditions, including increases in interest rates and credit spreads may adversely affect the liquidity of the fund\\u2019s investments.\\n\\u2022\\nMarket Trading Risk  - The fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, periods of high volatility and disruption in the creation and/or redemption process of the fund. Any of these factors, among others, may lead to the fund\\u2019s shares trading at a premium or discount to NAV. Thus, you may pay more (or less) than NAV when you buy shares of the fund in the secondary market, and you may receive less (or more) than NAV when you sell those shares in the secondary market. The portfolio managers cannot predict whether shares will trade above (premium), below (discount) or at NAV.\\n\\u2022\\nMarket Risk  - The risk that the value of securities owned by the fund may go up and down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably.\\n\\u2022\\nAuthorized Participant Concentration Risk  - Only an authorized participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the fund. The fund may have a limited number of institutions that act as authorized participants. To the extent that these institutions exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation and/or redemption orders with respect to the fund and no other authorized participant is able to step forward to process creation and/or redemption orders, fund shares may trade at a discount to net asset value (NAV) and possibly face trading halts and/or delisting. This risk may be more pronounced in volatile markets, potentially where there are significant redemptions in ETFs generally.\\n\\u2022\\nLarge Shareholder Risk - Certain shareholders, including other funds advised by the advisor, may from time to time own a substantial amount of the shares of the fund. In addition, a third party investor, the advisor or an affiliate of the advisor, an authorized participant, a market maker, or another entity may invest in the fund and hold its investment for a limited period of time solely to facilitate commencement of the fund or to facilitate the fund\\u2019s achieving a specified size or scale. There can be no assurance that any large shareholder would not redeem its investment, that the size of the fund would be maintained at such levels or that the fund would continue to meet applicable listing requirements. Redemptions by large shareholders could have a significant negative impact on the fund. In addition, transactions by large shareholders may account for a large percentage of the trading volume on the NYSE Arca, Inc. and may, therefore, have a material upward or downward effect on the market price of the shares.\\n\\u2022\\nPrincipal Loss Risk  - At any given time your shares may be worth less than the price you paid for them. In other words, it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund.\\nAn investment in the fund is not a bank deposit, and it is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other government agency.\\nFund Performance\\nThe fund\\u2019s performance history is not available as of the date of this prospectus. When the fund has investment results for a full calendar year, this section will feature charts that show annual total returns, highest and lowest quarterly returns and average annual total returns for the fund. This information indicates the volatility of the fund\\u2019s historical returns from year to year. For current performance information, please visit americancenturyetfs.com.\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\nPerformance information is designed to help you see how fund returns can vary. Keep in mind that past performance (before and after taxes) does not predict how the fund will perform in the future.\\nPortfolio Management\\nInvestment Advisor\\nAmerican Century Investment Management, Inc.\\nPortfolio Managers\\nSteven M. Permut, Senior Vice President and Senior Portfolio Manager, has served on teams managing fixed-income investments for American Century Investments since joining the advisor in 1987.\\nJoseph Gotelli, Vice President and Portfolio Manager, has served on teams managing fixed-income investments for American Century Investments since joining the advisor in 2008.\\nAlan Kruss, Vice President and Portfolio Manager, has served on teams managing fixed-income investments for American Century Investments since joining the advisor in 1997.\\nPurchase and Sale of Fund Shares\\nThe fund is an ETF. Fund shares may only be purchased and sold on a national securities exchange through a broker-dealer. The price of fund shares is based on market price, and because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than NAV, shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). The fund issues and redeems shares that have been aggregated into blocks of 50,000 shares or multiples thereof (Creation Units) to authorized participants who have entered into agreements with the fund\\u2019s distributor. The fund will generally issue and redeem Creation Units in return for a basket of cash and/or securities that the fund specifies each day.\\nTax Information\\nThe fund intends to distribute income that is exempt from regular federal income tax, however, fund distributions may be subject to capital gains tax. A portion of the fund\\u2019s distributions may be subject to federal income tax or to the federal alternative minimum tax.\\nIf you hold your fund shares through a tax-deferred investment plan, such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA, any distributions received from the fund may be taxable as ordinary income upon withdrawal from the tax-deferred plan, regardless of whether the distributions were tax-exempt when earned.\\nPayments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries\\nIf you purchase the fund through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the advisor and its related companies may pay the intermediary for the sale of fund shares and related services. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary\\u2019s website for more information.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

You may also incur usual and customary brokerage commissions when buying or selling shares of the Fund, which are not reflected in the Example that follows.\\n\\n\\nAnnual Fund Operating Expenses\\n\\n(expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment)\\n\\nManagement fees \\t0.09% \\nDistribution and service (12b-1) fees \\tNone \\nOther expenses1 \\tNone \\nTotal annual Fund operating expenses \\t0.09% \\n1. Other expenses are based on estimated amounts for the current fiscal year.\\n\\nExample\\n\\nThis Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of the period. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\\n\\n   \\t1 Year \\t3 Years \\n   \\t$ 9 \\t$ 29 \\nPortfolio Turnover\\n\\nThe Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or \\\"turns over\\\" its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual Fund operating expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund's performance. During the Fund's first fiscal period (November 2, 2017 to March 31, 2018), the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 1.90% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\\n\\nUnder normal market conditions, the Fund invests at least 80% of its assets in the component securities of the FTSE France Capped Index and in depositary receipts representing such securities. The FTSE France Capped Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index maintained and calculated by FTSE Russell with a capping methodology applied quarterly to issuer weights so that no single issuer of a component exceeds 25% of the FTSE France Capped Index weight, and all issuers with weights above 5% do not cumulatively exceed 50% of the FTSE France Capped Index\\u2019s weight. The FTSE France Capped Index is based on the FTSE France Index and is designed to measure the performance of French large- and mid-capitalization stocks. FTSE Russell determines eligible securities for the FTSE France Capped Index based on measures such as the company\\u2019s place of incorporation, quality of investor protection, tax domicile, location of headquarters/factors of production and currency of denomination. As of June 29, 2018, the FTSE France Capped Index was comprised of 87 securities with capitalizations ranging from $1.38 billion to $153.05 billion.\\n\\nThe Fund, using a \\u201cpassive\\u201d or indexing investment approach, seeks investment results that closely correspond, before fees and expenses, to the performance of the FTSE France Capped Index. The investment manager seeks to achieve, over time, a correlation between the Fund\\u2019s performance, before fees and expenses, and that of the FTSE France Capped Index of 0.95 or better. A figure of 1.00 would indicate perfect correlation. The Fund\\u2019s intention is to replicate the component securities of the FTSE France Capped Index as closely as possible (i.e., invest in all of the component securities in their respective weightings in the FTSE France Capped Index). However, under various circumstances, it may not be possible or practicable to replicate the FTSE France Capped Index. In these circumstances, the Fund may use a \\u201crepresentative sampling\\u201d strategy whereby the Fund would invest in what it believes to be a representative sample of the component securities of the FTSE France Capped Index, but may not track the FTSE France Capped Index with the same degree of accuracy as would an investment vehicle replicating the entire FTSE France Capped Index. Under the representative sampling technique, the investment manager will select securities that collectively have an investment profile similar to that of the FTSE France Capped Index, including securities that resemble those included in the FTSE France Capped Index in terms of risk factors, performance attributes and other characteristics, such as market capitalization and industry weightings.\\n\\nThe Fund is a \\\"non-diversified\\\" fund, which means it generally invests a greater proportion of its assets in the securities of one or more issuers and invests overall in a smaller number of issuers than a diversified fund.\\n\\nThe Fund will concentrate its investments (i.e., hold 25% or more of its net assets) in a particular industry or group of industries to approximately the same extent that the FTSE France Capped Index is concentrated.\\n\\nPrincipal Risks\\n\\nYou could lose money by investing in the Fund. Exchange-traded fund (ETF) shares are not deposits or obligations of, or guaranteed or endorsed by, any bank, and are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve Board, or any other agency of the U.S. government. The Fund is subject to the principal risks noted below, any of which may adversely affect the Fund\\u2019s net asset value (NAV), trading price, yield, total return and ability to meet its investment goal.\\n\\nMarket   The market values of securities or other investments owned by the Fund will go up or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The market value of a security or other investment may be reduced by market activity or other results of supply and demand unrelated to the issuer. This is a basic risk associated with all investments. When there are more sellers than buyers, prices tend to fall. Likewise, when there are more buyers than sellers, prices tend to rise.\\n\\nStock prices tend to go up and down more dramatically than those of debt securities. A slower-growth or recessionary economic environment could have an adverse effect on the prices of the various stocks held by the Fund.\\n\\nForeign Securities (non-U.S.)   Investing in foreign securities typically involves more risks than investing in U.S. securities, and includes risks associated with: (i) internal and external political and economic developments \\u2013 e.g., the political, economic and social policies and structures of some foreign countries may be less stable and more volatile than those in the U.S. or some foreign countries may be subject to trading restrictions or economic sanctions; (ii) trading practices \\u2013 e.g., government supervision and regulation of foreign securities and currency markets, trading systems and brokers may be less than in the U.S.; (iii) availability of information \\u2013 e.g., foreign issuers may not be subject to the same disclosure, accounting and financial reporting standards and practices as U.S. issuers; (iv) limited markets \\u2013 e.g., the securities of certain foreign issuers may be less liquid (harder to sell) and more volatile; and (v) currency exchange rate fluctuations and policies (e.g., fluctuations may negatively affect investments denominated in foreign currencies and any income received or expenses paid by the Fund in that foreign currency).\\n\\nGeographic Focus   Because the Fund invests its assets primarily in companies in a specific country and region, the Fund is subject to greater risks of adverse developments in that country, region and/or the surrounding regions than a fund that is more broadly diversified geographically. Political, social or economic disruptions in the country or region, even in countries in which the Fund is not invested, may adversely affect the value of investments held by the Fund. Current political uncertainty surrounding the European Union (EU) and its membership, including the 2016 referendum in which the United Kingdom voted to exit the EU, may increase market volatility.\\n\\nThe Fund\\u2019s investment in French issuers subjects the Fund to legal, regulatory, political, currency, security, and economic risks specific to France. Recently, new concerns emerged with respect to the economic outlook for certain EU countries, including France. As a result, the French economy has experienced significant volatility and adverse trends due to concerns about a prolonged economic downturn and rising government debt levels. The French economy is dependent on agricultural exports, and as a result, is susceptible to fluctuations in demand for agricultural products.\\n\\nDepositary Receipts   Depositary receipts are subject to many of the risks of the underlying securities. For some depositary receipts, the custodian or similar financial institution that holds the issuer's shares in a trust account is located in the issuer's home country. In these cases if the issuer\\u2019s home country does not have developed financial markets, the Fund could be exposed to the credit risk of the custodian or financial institution and greater market risk. In addition, the depository institution may not have physical custody of the underlying securities at all times and may charge fees for various services. The Fund may experience delays in receiving its dividend and interest payments or exercising rights as a shareholder. There may be an increased possibility of untimely responses to certain corporate actions of the issuer in an unsponsored depositary receipt program. Accordingly, there may be less information available regarding issuers of securities underlying unsponsored programs and there may not be a correlation between this information and the market value of the depositary receipts.\\n\\nCalculation Methodology   FTSE Russell relies on various sources of information to assess the criteria of issuers included in the FTSE France Capped Index, including information that may be based on assumptions and estimates. Neither the Fund nor the investment manager can offer assurances that FTSE Russell\\u2019s calculation methodology or sources of information will provide an accurate assessment of included issuers or that the included issuers will provide the Fund with the market exposure it seeks.\\n\\nIndex-Related   There is no assurance that the FTSE France Capped Index will be determined, composed or calculated accurately. While FTSE Russell provides descriptions of what the FTSE France Capped Index is designed to achieve, FTSE Russell does not guarantee the quality, accuracy or completeness of data in respect of its indices, and does not guarantee that the FTSE France Capped Index will be in line with the described index methodology. Gains, losses or costs to the Fund caused by errors in the FTSE France Capped Index may therefore be borne by the Fund and its shareholders.\\n\\nNon-Correlation   There is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve a high degree of correlation to the FTSE France Capped Index and therefore achieve its investment goal. Market disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund\\u2019s ability to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order to track the FTSE France Capped Index. In addition, the Fund\\u2019s NAV may deviate from the FTSE France Capped Index if the Fund fair values a portfolio security at a price other than the price used by the FTSE France Capped Index for that security. To the extent that the investment manager uses a representative sampling strategy, the Fund may not track the return of the FTSE France Capped Index as well as it would have if the Fund held all of the securities in the FTSE France Capped Index.\\n\\nTracking Error   Tracking error is the divergence of the Fund\\u2019s performance from that of the FTSE France Capped Index. Tracking error may occur because of differences between the securities held in the Fund\\u2019s portfolio and those included in the FTSE France Capped Index, pricing differences (including differences between a security\\u2019s price at the local market close and the Fund\\u2019s valuation of a security at the time of calculation of the Fund\\u2019s NAV), transaction costs, the Fund\\u2019s holding of cash, differences in timing of the accrual of dividends or interest, tax gains or losses, changes to the FTSE France Capped Index or the need to meet various new or existing regulatory requirements. This risk may be heightened during times of increased market volatility or other unusual market conditions. Tracking error also may result because the Fund incurs fees and expenses, while the FTSE France Capped Index does not.\\n\\nMarket Trading   The Fund faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Fund shares, losses from trading in secondary markets, periods of high volatility and disruption in the creation/redemption process of the Fund. Any of these factors, among others, may lead to the Fund\\u2019s shares trading at a premium or discount to NAV. Thus, you may pay more (or less) than NAV when you buy shares of the Fund in the secondary market, and you may receive less (or more) than NAV when you sell those shares in the secondary market. The investment manager cannot predict whether shares will trade above (premium), below (discount) or at NAV.\\n\\nConcentration   To the extent the Fund concentrates in a specific industry, a group of industries, sector or type of investment, the Fund will carry much greater risks of adverse developments and price movements in such industries, sectors or investments than a fund that invests in a wider variety of industries, sectors or investments. There is also the risk that the Fund will perform poorly during a slump in demand for securities of companies in such industries or sectors.\\n\\nNon-Diversification   Because the Fund is non-diversified, it may be more sensitive to economic, business, political or other changes affecting individual issuers or investments than a diversified fund, which may result in greater fluctuation in the value of the Fund\\u2019s shares and greater risk of loss.\\n\\nMidsize Companies   Securities issued by midsize companies may be more volatile in price than those of larger companies, involve substantial risks and should be considered speculative. Such risks may include greater sensitivity to economic conditions, less certain growth prospects, lack of depth of management and funds for growth and development, and limited or less developed product lines and markets. In addition, midsize companies may be particularly affected by interest rate increases, as they may find it more difficult to borrow money to continue or expand operations, or may have difficulty in repaying any loans.\\n\\nPassive Investment   Unlike many investment companies, the Fund is not actively managed and the investment manager does not attempt to take defensive positions under any market conditions, including declining markets. Therefore, the investment manager would not necessarily buy or sell a security unless that security is added or removed, respectively, from the FTSE France Capped Index, even if that security generally is underperforming.\\n\\nInternational Closed Market Trading   To the extent that the underlying securities held by the Fund trade on an exchange that is closed when the securities exchange on which the Fund shares list and trade is open, there may be market uncertainty about the stale security pricing (i.e., the last quote from its closed foreign market) resulting in premiums or discounts to NAV that may be greater than those experienced by other ETFs.\\n\\nAuthorized Participant Concentration   Only an authorized participant (Authorized Participant) may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund. The Fund has a limited number of institutions that act as Authorized Participants. To the extent that these institutions exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation and/or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units (as defined below), Fund shares may trade at a discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts and/or delisting. This risk may be more pronounced in volatile markets, potentially where there are significant redemptions in ETFs generally.\\n\\nPerformance\\n\\nBecause the Fund does not have a full calendar year of performance, annual total return information is not available and therefore is not presented. You can obtain updated performance information at libertyshares.com or by calling (800) DIAL BEN/342-5236. The Fund's past performance (before and after taxes) is not necessarily an indication of how the Fund will perform in the future.\\n\\nInvestment Manager\\n\\nFranklin Advisers, Inc.

Fund shares may only be purchased and sold on a national securities exchange through a broker-dealer. The price of Fund shares is based on market price, and because ETF shares trade at market prices rather than NAV, shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (a premium) or less than NAV (a discount). The Fund issues or redeems shares that have been aggregated into blocks of 100,000 shares or multiples thereof (Creation Units) to Authorized Participants who have entered into agreements with the Fund\\u2019s distributor, Franklin Templeton Distributors, Inc. The Fund will generally issue or redeem Creation Units in return for a basket of securities (and an amount of cash) that the Fund specifies each day.\\n\\nTaxes\\n\\nThe Fund\\u2019s distributions are generally taxable to you as ordinary income, capital gains, or some combination of both, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or an individual retirement account, in which case your distributions would generally be taxed when withdrawn from the tax-deferred account.\\n\\nPayments to Broker-Dealers and\\nOther Financial Intermediaries\\n\\nIf you purchase shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), Advisers or other related companies may pay the intermediary for the sale of Fund shares and related services. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary's website for more information.\",\n          \"American Funds College Enrollment Fund\\n\\nInvestment objective The fund\\u2019s investment objective is to provide current income, consistent with preservation of capital.\\n\\nFees and expenses of the fund This table describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold shares of the fund.

The example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the fund\\u2019s operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\\n\\n \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\nShare class:\\t529-A\\t529-C\\t529-E\\t529-T\\t529-F-1\\tFor the share class listed to the right, you would pay the following if you did not redeem your shares:\\tShare class:\\t529-C\\n1 year\\t$ 326\\t$ 252\\t$ 98\\t$ 331\\t$ 50\\t1 year\\t$ 152\\n3 years\\t487\\t471\\t306\\t502\\t157\\t3 years\\t471\\n5 years\\t662\\t813\\t531\\t688\\t274\\t5 years\\t813\\n10 years\\t1,169\\t1,779\\t1,178\\t1,227\\t616\\t10 years\\t1,779\\nPortfolio turnover The fund may pay transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or \\u201cturns over\\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the fund\\u2019s investment results. During the most recent fiscal year, the fund\\u2019s portfolio turnover rate was 4% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\nPrincipal investment strategies The fund will attempt to achieve its investment objective by investing in a mix of American Funds bond funds. The fund will principally invest in funds that seek current income through bond investments. The fund is designed for investors who attend college currently or plan to in the near future.\\n\\nWhen determining in which bond funds to invest, the investment adviser will predominately seek exposure to higher quality bonds (rated A- or better or A3 or better by Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations designated by the fund\\u2019s investment adviser, or unrated but determined by the fund\\u2019s investment adviser to be of equivalent quality) with intermediate to short-term durations. The fund may, however, invest in underlying funds with exposure to lower quality, higher yielding securities rated BBB+ or below and Baa1 or below (including those rated BB+ or below and Ba1 or below) or unrated but determined by the fund\\u2019s investment adviser to be of equivalent quality, and to bonds with longer durations.\\n\\nThe underlying funds may hold securities issued and guaranteed by the U.S. government, securities issued by federal agencies and instrumentalities and securities backed by mortgages or other assets. The investment adviser anticipates that exposure to mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities may help the fund generate current income. The underlying funds may also invest in the debt securities of governments, agencies, corporations and other entities domiciled outside the United States.\\n\\nThe fund\\u2019s investment adviser seeks to create a combination of underlying funds that complement each other with a goal of achieving the fund\\u2019s investment objective of providing current income, consistent with preservation of capital. In making this determination, the fund\\u2019s investment adviser considers the historical volatility and returns of the underlying funds and how various combinations would have behaved in past market environments. It also considers, among other topics, current market conditions and the investment positions of the underlying funds.\\n\\nPrincipal risks This section describes the principal risks associated with investing in the fund and its underlying funds. You may lose money by investing in the fund. The likelihood of loss may be greater if you invest for a shorter period of time. Investors in the fund should have a long-term perspective and be able to tolerate potentially sharp declines in value.\\n\\nThe following are principal risks associated with the fund\\u2019s investment strategies.\\n\\nAllocation risk \\u2014 Investments in the fund are subject to risks related to the investment adviser\\u2019s allocation choices. The selection of the underlying funds and the allocation of the fund\\u2019s assets could cause the fund to lose value or its results to lag relevant benchmarks or other funds with similar objectives.\\n\\nFund structure \\u2014 The fund invests in underlying funds and incurs expenses related to the underlying funds. In addition, investors in the fund will incur fees to pay for certain expenses related to the operations of the fund. An investor holding the underlying funds directly and in the same proportions as the fund would incur lower overall expenses but would not receive the benefit of the portfolio management and other services provided by the fund.\\n\\nUnderlying fund risks \\u2014 Because the fund\\u2019s investments consist of underlying funds, the fund\\u2019s risks are directly related to the risks of the underlying funds. For this reason, it is important to understand the risks associated with investing in the underlying funds, as described below.\\n\\nAmerican Funds College Target Date Series / Prospectus     44\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nThe following are principal risks associated with the underlying funds\\u2019 investment strategies.\\n\\nMarket conditions \\u2014 The prices of, and the income generated by, the common stocks, bonds and other securities held by the underlying funds may decline \\u2013 sometimes rapidly or unpredictably \\u2013 due to various factors, including events or conditions affecting the general economy or particular industries; overall market changes; local, regional or global political, social or economic instability; governmental, governmental agency or central bank responses to economic conditions; and currency exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price fluctuations.\\n\\nIssuer risks \\u2014 The prices of, and the income generated by, securities held by the underlying funds may decline in response to various factors directly related to the issuers of such securities, including reduced demand for an issuer\\u2019s goods or services, poor management performance, major litigation against the issuer, changes in government regulations affecting the issuer or its competitive environment and strategic initiatives such as mergers, acquisitions or dispositions and the market response to any such initiatives.\\n\\nInvesting in debt instruments \\u2014 The prices of, and the income generated by, bonds and other debt securities held by an underlying fund may be affected by changing interest rates and by changes in the effective maturities and credit ratings of these securities.\\n\\nRising interest rates will generally cause the prices of bonds and other debt securities to fall. A general rise in interest rates may cause investors to sell debt securities on a large scale, which could also adversely affect the price and liquidity of debt securities and could also result in increased redemptions from the fund. Falling interest rates may cause an issuer to redeem, call or refinance a debt security before its stated maturity, which may result in the fund failing to recoup the full amount of its initial investment and having to reinvest the proceeds in lower yielding securities. Longer maturity debt securities generally have greater sensitivity to changes in interest rates and may be subject to greater price fluctuations than shorter maturity debt securities.\\n\\nBonds and other debt securities are also subject to credit risk, which is the possibility that the credit strength of an issuer or guarantor will weaken or be perceived to be weaker, and/or an issuer of a debt security will fail to make timely payments of principal or interest and the security will go into default. A downgrade or default affecting any of the underlying funds\\u2019 securities could cause the value of the underlying funds\\u2019 shares to decrease. Credit risk is gauged, in part, by the credit ratings of the debt securities in which the underlying fund invests. However, ratings are only the opinions of the rating agencies issuing them and are not guarantees as to credit quality or an evaluation of market risk. The underlying funds\\u2019 investment adviser relies on its own credit analysts to research issuers and issues in seeking to assess credit and default risks. These risks will be more significant as the fund approaches its target date because a greater proportion of the fund\\u2019s assets will consist of underlying funds that primarily invest in bonds.\\n\\nInvesting in lower rated debt instruments \\u2014 Lower rated bonds and other lower rated debt securities generally have higher rates of interest and involve greater risk of default or price declines due to changes in the issuer\\u2019s creditworthiness than those of higher quality debt securities. The market prices of these securities may fluctuate more than the prices of higher quality debt securities and may decline significantly in periods of general economic difficulty. These risks may be increased with respect to investments in lower quality, higher yielding debt securities rated Ba1 or below and BB+ or below by Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations designated by the fund\\u2019s investment adviser or unrated but determined by the investment adviser to be of equivalent quality, which securities are sometimes referred to as \\u201cjunk bonds.\\u201d\\n\\nInvesting outside the United States \\u2014 Securities of issuers domiciled outside the United States, or with significant operations or revenues outside the United States, may lose value because of adverse political, social, economic or market developments (including social instability, regional conflicts, terrorism and war) in the countries or regions in which the issuers operate or generate revenue. These securities may also lose value due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar and/or currencies of other countries. Issuers of these securities may be more susceptible to actions of foreign governments, such as nationalization, currency blockage or the imposition of price controls or punitive taxes, each of which could adversely impact the value of these securities. Securities markets in certain countries may be more volatile and/or less liquid than those in the United States. Investments outside the United States may also be subject to different accounting practices and different regulatory, legal and reporting standards and practices, and may be more difficult to value, than those in the United States. In addition, the value of investments outside the United States may be reduced by foreign taxes, including foreign withholding taxes on interest and dividends. Further, there may be increased risks of delayed settlement of securities purchased or sold by an underlying fund. The risks of investing outside the United States may be heightened in connection with investments in emerging markets.\\n\\nInvesting in mortgage-related and other asset-backed securities \\u2014 Mortgage-related securities, such as mortgage-backed securities, and other asset-backed securities, include debt obligations that represent interests in pools of mortgages or other income-bearing assets, such as consumer loans or receivables. Such securities often involve risks that are different from or more acute than the risks associated with investing in other types of debt securities. Mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities are subject to changes in the payment patterns of borrowers of the underlying debt, potentially increasing the volatility of the securities and an underlying fund\\u2019s net asset value. When interest rates fall, borrowers are more likely to refinance or prepay their debt before its stated maturity. This may result in an underlying fund having to reinvest the proceeds in lower yielding securities, effectively reducing the underlying fund\\u2019s income. Conversely, if interest rates rise and borrowers repay their debt more slowly than expected, the time in which the mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities are paid off could be extended, reducing an underlying fund\\u2019s cash available for reinvestment in higher yielding securities. Mortgage-backed securities are also subject to the risk that underlying borrowers will be unable to meet their obligations and the value of property that secures the mortgages may decline in value and be insufficient, upon foreclosure, to repay the associated loans. Investments in asset-backed securities are subject to similar risks.\\n\\nInvesting in securities backed by the U.S. government \\u2014 Securities backed by the U.S. Treasury or the full faith and credit of the U.S. government are guaranteed only as to the timely payment of interest and principal when held to maturity. Accordingly, the current market values for these securities will fluctuate with changes in interest rates and the credit rating of the U.S. government. Securities issued by\\n\\n45     American Funds College Target Date Series / Prospectus\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\ngovernment-sponsored entities and federal agencies and instrumentalities that are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government are neither issued nor guaranteed by the U.S. government.\\n\\nInvesting in future delivery contracts \\u2014 An underlying fund may enter into contracts, such as to-be-announced contracts and mortgage dollar rolls, that involve an underlying fund selling mortgage-related securities and simultaneously contracting to repurchase similar securities for delivery at a future date at a predetermined price. This can increase the underlying fund\\u2019s market exposure, and the market price of the securities that the underlying fund contracts to repurchase could drop below their purchase price. While an underlying fund can preserve and generate capital through the use of such contracts by, for example, realizing the difference between the sale price and the future purchase price, the income generated by the underlying fund may be reduced by engaging in such transactions. In addition, these transactions may increase the turnover rate of the underlying fund.\\n\\nInvesting in derivatives \\u2014 The use of derivatives involves a variety of risks, which may be different from, or greater than, the risks associated with investing in traditional securities, such as stocks and bonds. Changes in the value of a derivative may not correlate perfectly with, and may be more sensitive to market events than, the underlying asset, rate or index, and a derivative instrument may expose the underlying fund to losses in excess of its initial investment. Derivatives may be difficult to value, difficult for the underlying fund to buy or sell at an opportune time or price and difficult to terminate or otherwise offset. The underlying fund\\u2019s use of derivatives may result in losses to the underlying fund, and investing in derivatives may reduce the underlying fund\\u2019s returns and increase the underlying fund\\u2019s price volatility. The underlying fund\\u2019s counterparty to a derivative transaction (including, if applicable, the underlying fund\\u2019s clearing broker, the derivatives exchange or the clearinghouse) may be unable or unwilling to honor its financial obligations in respect of the transaction.\\n\\nManagement \\u2014 The investment adviser to the fund and to the underlying funds actively manages each underlying fund\\u2019s investments. Consequently, the underlying funds are subject to the risk that the methods and analyses, including models, tools and data, employed by the investment adviser in this process may be flawed or incorrect and may not produce the desired results. This could cause an underlying fund to lose value or its investment results to lag relevant benchmarks or other funds with similar objectives.\\n\\nYour investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency, entity or person. You should consider how this fund fits into your overall investment program.\\n\\nInvestment results The following bar chart shows how the fund\\u2019s investment results have varied from year to year, and the following table shows how the fund\\u2019s average annual total returns for various periods compare with a broad measure of securities market results and other applicable measures of market results.

Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:\\nIf Shares are redeemed:\\t1 Year\\t3 Years\\t5 Years\\t10 Years\\nClass A Shares\\t$\\u2002685\\t$\\u2002919\\t$\\u20021,172\\t$\\u20021,892\\nClass C Shares\\t$\\u2002296\\t$\\u2002606\\t$\\u20021,042\\t$\\u20022,254\\nClass S Shares\\t$\\u2002133\\t$\\u2002415\\t$ \\u2002718\\t$\\u20021,579\\nClass I Shares\\t$ \\u200289\\t$\\u2002278\\t$ \\u2002482\\t$\\u20021,073\\n40\\u2002\\tJanus Henderson Global Real Estate Fund\\n \\n\\nIf Shares are redeemed:\\t1 Year\\t3 Years\\t5 Years\\t10 Years\\nClass N Shares\\t$ \\u200281\\t$\\u2002252\\t$\\u2002439\\t$ \\u2002978\\nClass T Shares\\t$\\u2002106\\t$\\u2002331\\t$\\u2002574\\t$\\u20021,271\\n  \\n    \\nIf Shares are not redeemed:\\t1 Year\\t3 Years\\t5 Years\\t10 Years\\nClass A Shares\\t$\\u2002685\\t$\\u2002919\\t$\\u20021,172\\t$\\u20021,892\\nClass C Shares\\t$\\u2002196\\t$\\u2002606\\t$\\u20021,042\\t$\\u20022,254\\nClass S Shares\\t$\\u2002133\\t$\\u2002415\\t$ \\u2002718\\t$\\u20021,579\\nClass I Shares\\t$ \\u200289\\t$\\u2002278\\t$ \\u2002482\\t$\\u20021,073\\nClass N Shares\\t$ \\u200281\\t$\\u2002252\\t$ \\u2002439\\t$ \\u2002978\\nClass T Shares\\t$\\u2002106\\t$\\u2002331\\t$ \\u2002574\\t$\\u20021,271\\n  \\nPortfolio Turnover:  The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or \\u201cturns over\\u201d its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund\\u2019s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund\\u2019s portfolio turnover rate was 72% of the average value of its portfolio.\\nPRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGIES\\nThe Fund pursues its investment objective by investing, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in equity securities of real estate-related companies. Such companies may include those in the real estate industry or real estate-related industries. These securities may include common stocks, preferred stocks, and other equity securities, including, but not limited to, real estate investment trusts (\\u201cREITs\\u201d) and similar REIT-like entities, such as foreign entities that have REIT characteristics. From time to time, the Fund may invest in shares of companies through initial public offerings.\\nAs a fundamental policy, the Fund will concentrate 25% or more of its net assets in securities of issuers in real estate or real estate-related industries. The Fund\\u2019s investment in companies engaged in businesses outside the real estate industry which possess significant real estate holdings will be deemed to be in the real estate industry for purposes of the Fund\\u2019s investment objective and its policy on industry concentration.\\nReal estate-related industries are comprised of companies that, in the opinion of the portfolio managers, at the time of investment, generally (i) derive at least 50% of their revenue from ownership, construction, extraction, financing, management, operation, sales or development of real estate, or from businesses which have a clear relationship to these activities; (ii) have at least 50% of their assets in real estate; or (iii) have more than 50% of their net asset value accounted for by real estate.\\nA REIT is a company dedicated to owning, and usually operating, income-producing real estate, or to financing real estate. REITs pool investors\\u2019 funds for investment primarily in income-producing real estate or real estate-related loans or interests. Under the Internal Revenue Code, a REIT is not taxed on income it distributes to its shareholders if it complies with several requirements relating to its organization, ownership, assets and income, and a requirement that it generally distributes to its shareholders at least 90% of its taxable income (other than net capital gains) for each taxable year.\\nThe Fund also invests in non-U.S. real estate and real estate-related companies. The Fund expects under normal market conditions to maintain investments in issuers that are economically tied to different countries throughout the world, including the United States. The Fund may also invest in companies or issuers that are economically tied to emerging markets. Under unusual circumstances, the Fund may invest all of its assets in a single country.\\nIn choosing investments for the Fund, the portfolio managers apply a \\u201cbottom up\\u201d approach that utilizes the portfolio managers\\u2019 knowledge of issuers in the Americas and the Asia Pacific and European regions. The portfolio managers may also apply a \\u201ctop down\\u201d analysis of property markets and sectors, economics, and capital markets in seeking to limit the Fund\\u2019s exposures to various risks.\\nThe Fund may invest its assets in derivatives, which are instruments that have a value derived from, or directly linked to, an underlying asset, such as equity securities, fixed-income securities, commodities, currencies, interest rates, or market indices, as substitutes for securities in which the Fund invests. For purposes of meeting its 80% investment policy, the Fund may\\n41\\u2002\\tJanus Henderson Global Real Estate Fund\\n \\n\\ninclude derivatives that have characteristics similar to the securities in which the Fund may directly invest. In particular, the Fund may use forward currency contracts to offset risks associated with currency exposure.\\nThe Fund may lend portfolio securities on a short-term or long-term basis, in an amount equal to up to one-third of its total assets as determined at the time of the loan origination.\\nPRINCIPAL INVESTMENT RISKS\\nThe biggest risk is that the Fund\\u2019s returns will vary, and you could lose money. The Fund is designed for long-term investors interested in investments focused in the real estate industry or real estate-related industries, including common stocks. Common stocks tend to be more volatile than many other investment choices.\\nReal Estate Securities Risk.  An investment in the Fund may be subject to many of the same risks as a direct investment in real estate. The value of real estate-related companies\\u2019 securities is sensitive to changes in real estate values and rental income, property taxes, interest rates, tax and regulatory requirements, supply and demand, and the management skill and creditworthiness of the company. Investments in REITs involve the same risks as other real estate investments. In addition, a REIT could fail to qualify for tax-free pass-through of its income under the Internal Revenue Code or fail to maintain its exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, which could produce adverse economic consequences for the REIT and its investors, including the Fund.\\nConcentration Risk.  Since the Fund concentrates its assets in the real estate or real estate-related industry, an investment in the Fund will be closely linked to performance of the real estate markets. As a result, the Fund may be subject to greater risks and its net asset value may fluctuate more than a fund that does not concentrate its investments.\\nForeign Exposure Risk.  The Fund normally has significant exposure to foreign markets as a result of its investments in foreign securities, including investments in emerging markets, which can be more volatile than the U.S. markets. As a result, its returns and net asset value may be affected to a large degree by fluctuations in currency exchange rates or political or economic conditions in a particular country. In some foreign markets, there may not be protection against failure by other parties to complete transactions. It may not be possible for the Fund to repatriate capital, dividends, interest, and other income from a particular country or governmental entity. In addition, a market swing in one or more countries or regions where the Fund has invested a significant amount of its assets may have a greater effect on the Fund\\u2019s performance than it would in a more geographically diversified portfolio. The Fund\\u2019s investments in emerging market countries may involve risks greater than, or in addition to, the risks of investing in more developed countries.\\nEmerging Markets Risk.  The risks of foreign investing mentioned above are heightened when investing in emerging markets. Emerging markets securities involve a number of additional risks, which may result from less government supervision and regulation of business and industry practices (including the potential lack of strict finance and accounting controls and standards), stock exchanges, brokers, and listed companies, making these investments potentially more volatile in price and less liquid than investments in developed securities markets, resulting in greater risk to investors. There is a risk in developing countries that a future economic or political crisis could lead to price controls, forced mergers of companies, expropriation or confiscatory taxation, imposition or enforcement of foreign ownership limits, seizure, nationalization, sanctions or imposition of restrictions by various governmental entities on investment and trading, or creation of government monopolies, any of which may have a detrimental effect on the Fund\\u2019s investments. In addition, the Fund\\u2019s investments may be denominated in foreign currencies and therefore, changes in the value of a country\\u2019s currency compared to the U.S. dollar may affect the value of the Fund\\u2019s investments. To the extent that the Fund invests a significant portion of its assets in the securities of issuers in or companies of a single country or region, it is more likely to be impacted by events or conditions affecting that country or region, which could have a negative impact on the Fund\\u2019s performance. Some of the risks of investing directly in foreign and emerging market securities may be reduced when the Fund invests indirectly in foreign securities through various other investment vehicles including derivatives, which also involve other risks. As of September 30, 2017, approximately 7.7% of the Fund\\u2019s investments were in emerging markets (i.e. countries included in the MSCI Emerging Markets Indexsm).\\nMarket Risk.  The value of the Fund\\u2019s portfolio may decrease if the value of an individual company or security, or multiple companies or securities, in the portfolio decreases or if the portfolio managers\\u2019 belief about a company\\u2019s intrinsic worth is incorrect. Further, regardless of how well individual companies or securities perform, the value of the Fund\\u2019s portfolio could also decrease if there are deteriorating economic or market conditions. It is important to understand that the value of your\\n42\\u2002\\tJanus Henderson Global Real Estate Fund\\n \\n\\ninvestment may fall, sometimes sharply, in response to changes in the market, and you could lose money. Market risk may affect a single issuer, industry, economic sector, or the market as a whole.\\nInitial Public Offering Risk.  The Fund\\u2019s purchase of shares issued in an initial public offering (\\u201cIPO\\u201d) exposes it to the risks associated with companies that have little operating history as public companies, as well as to the risks inherent in those sectors of the market where these new issuers operate. Although IPO investments may have had a positive impact on the Fund\\u2019s performance in the past, there can be no assurance that the Fund will identify favorable IPO investment opportunities in the future. In addition, as the Fund increases in size, the impact of IPOs on the Fund\\u2019s performance will generally decrease.\\nDerivatives Risk.  Derivatives can be highly volatile and involve risks in addition to the risks of the underlying referenced securities or asset. Gains or losses from a derivative investment can be substantially greater than the derivative\\u2019s original cost, and can therefore involve leverage. Leverage may cause the Fund to be more volatile than if it had not used leverage. Derivatives can be less liquid than other types of investments and entail the risk that the counterparty will default on its payment obligations. The Fund may use derivatives, including forward currency contracts, for hedging purposes. Hedging with derivatives may increase expenses, and there is no guarantee that a hedging strategy will work. While hedging can reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains or cause losses if the market moves in a manner different from that anticipated by the Fund or if the cost of the derivative outweighs the benefit of the hedge.\\nSecurities Lending Risk.  The Fund may seek to earn additional income through lending its securities to certain qualified broker-dealers and institutions. There is the risk that when portfolio securities are lent, the securities may not be returned on a timely basis, and the Fund may experience delays and costs in recovering the security or gaining access to the collateral provided to the Fund to collateralize the loan. If the Fund is unable to recover a security on loan, the Fund may use the collateral to purchase replacement securities in the market. There is a risk that the value of the collateral could decrease below the cost of the replacement security by the time the replacement investment is made, resulting in a loss to the Fund.\\nManagement Risk.  The Fund is an actively managed investment portfolio and is therefore subject to the risk that the investment strategies employed for the Fund may fail to produce the intended results. The Fund may underperform its benchmark index or other mutual funds with similar investment objectives.\\nAn investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.\\nPERFORMANCE INFORMATION\\nThe following information provides some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by showing how the Fund\\u2019s performance has varied over time. Class I Shares, Class A Shares, Class C Shares, and Class S Shares of the Fund commenced operations on July 6, 2009, after the reorganization of each corresponding class of shares of Janus Adviser Global Real Estate Fund (the \\u201cJAD predecessor fund\\u201d) into each respective share class of the Fund. Class T Shares of the Fund commenced operations on July 6, 2009.

Thereafter the fund's objective will be to seek high current income and, as a secondary objective, capital appreciation.\\n\\nFee Table\\n\\nThe following table describes the fees and expenses that may be incurred when you buy and hold shares of the fund.\\n\\nShareholder fees\\n\\n(fees paid directly from your investment) \\tNone \\nAnnual Operating Expenses\\n\\n(expenses that you pay each year as a % of the value of your investment)\\n\\nManagement fee(a) \\t \\t0.53% \\nDistribution and/or Service (12b-1) fees \\t \\tNone \\nOther expenses(a) \\t \\t0.00% \\nTotal annual operating expenses(a) \\t \\t0.53% \\n(a)   Adjusted to reflect current fees.\\n\\nThis example helps compare the cost of investing in the fund with the cost of investing in other funds.\\n\\nLet's say, hypothetically, that the annual return for shares of the fund is 5% and that your shareholder fees and the annual operating expenses for shares of the fund are exactly as described in the fee table. This example illustrates the effect of fees and expenses, but is not meant to suggest actual or expected fees and expenses or returns, all of which may vary. For every $10,000 you invested, here's how much you would pay in total expenses if you sell all of your shares at the end of each time period indicated:\\n\\n1 year \\t$54 \\n3 years \\t$165 \\n5 years \\t$284 \\n10 years \\t$611 \\nPortfolio Turnover\\n\\nThe fund will not incur transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells shares of underlying Fidelity\\u00ae funds (or \\\"turns over\\\" its portfolio), but it could incur transaction costs if it were to buy and sell other types of securities directly. If the fund were to buy and sell other types of securities directly, a higher portfolio turnover rate could indicate higher transaction costs and could result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account. Such costs, if incurred, would not be reflected in annual operating expenses or in the example and would affect the fund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the fund's portfolio turnover rate was 19% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\\n\\nInvesting in a combination of Fidelity\\u00ae domestic equity funds, international equity funds (developed and emerging markets), bond funds, and short-term funds (underlying Fidelity\\u00ae funds).\\nAllocating assets according to a neutral asset allocation strategy shown in the glide path below that becomes increasingly conservative until it reaches an allocation similar to that of the Fidelity Freedom\\u00ae Income Fund, approximately 10 to 19 years after the year 2010 (approximately 17% in domestic equity funds, 7% in international equity funds, 46% in bond funds, and 30% in short-term funds).\\nBuying and selling futures contracts (both long and short positions) in an effort to manage cash flows efficiently, remain fully invested, or facilitate asset allocation.\\nFMR Co., Inc. (FMRC) may continue to seek high total return for several years beyond the fund's target retirement date in an effort to achieve the fund's overall investment objective.\\n\\nAs of March 31, 2018, the fund's neutral asset allocation to underlying Fidelity\\u00ae funds and futures was approximately:\\n   \\tDomestic Equity Funds* \\t29% \\n   \\tInternational Equity Funds* \\t13% \\n   \\tBond Funds* \\t40% \\n   \\tShort-Term Funds* \\t19% \\n\\n* FMRC may change these percentages over time. As a result of the active asset allocation strategy (discussed below), actual allocations may differ from the neutral allocations above. The allocation percentages may not add to 100% due to rounding.\\n\\nFMRC may use an active asset allocation strategy to increase or decrease neutral asset class exposures reflected above by up to 10% for equity funds (includes domestic equity and international equity funds), bond funds and short-term funds to reflect FMRC's market outlook, which is primarily focused on the intermediate term. The asset allocations in the glide path and pie chart above are referred to as neutral because they do not reflect any decisions made by FMRC to overweight or underweight an asset class.\\nFMRC may also make active asset allocations within other asset classes (including commodities, high yield debt, floating rate debt, real estate debt, inflation-protected debt, and emerging markets debt) from 0% to 10% individually but no more than 25% in aggregate within those other asset classes. Such asset classes are not reflected in the neutral asset allocations reflected in the glide path and pie chart above.\\nDesigned for investors who retired in or within a few years of 2010 (target retirement date) at or around age 65 and plan to gradually withdraw the value of their account in the fund over time.\\nPrincipal Investment Risks\\n\\nShareholders should consider that no target date fund is intended as a complete retirement program and there is no guarantee that any single fund will provide sufficient retirement income at or through your retirement. The fund's share price fluctuates, which means you could lose money by investing in the fund, including losses near, at or after the target retirement date.\\n\\nAsset Allocation Risk.  The fund is subject to risks resulting from the Adviser's asset allocation decisions. The selection of underlying funds and the allocation of the fund's assets among various asset classes could cause the fund to lose value or its results to lag relevant benchmarks or other funds with similar objectives. In addition, the fund's active asset allocation strategy may cause the fund to have a risk profile different than that portrayed above from time to time and may increase losses.\\nInvesting in Other Funds.  The fund bears all risks of investment strategies employed by the underlying funds, including the risk that the underlying funds will not meet their investment objectives.\\nStock Market Volatility.  Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments. Different parts of the market, including different market sectors, and different types of securities can react differently to these developments.\\nInterest Rate Changes.  Interest rate increases can cause the price of a debt or money market security to decrease.\\nForeign Exposure.  Foreign markets, particularly emerging markets, can be more volatile than the U.S. market due to increased risks of adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments and can perform differently from the U.S. market. Emerging markets can be subject to greater social, economic, regulatory, and political uncertainties and can be extremely volatile. Foreign exchange rates also can be extremely volatile.\\nIndustry Exposure.  Market conditions, interest rates, and economic, regulatory, or financial developments could significantly affect a single industry or group of related industries.\\nPrepayment.  The ability of an issuer of a debt security to repay principal prior to a security's maturity can cause greater price volatility if interest rates change.\\nIssuer-Specific Changes.  The value of an individual security or particular type of security can be more volatile than, and can perform differently from, the market as a whole. A decline in the credit quality of an issuer or a provider of credit support or a maturity-shortening structure for a security can cause the price of a security to decrease. Lower-quality debt securities (those of less than investment-grade quality, also referred to as high yield debt securities or junk bonds) and certain types of other securities involve greater risk of default or price changes due to changes in the credit quality of the issuer. The value of lower-quality debt securities and certain types of other securities can be more volatile due to increased sensitivity to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.\\nLeverage Risk.  Leverage can increase market exposure, magnify investment risks, and cause losses to be realized more quickly.\\n\\\"Value\\\" Investing.  \\\"Value\\\" stocks can perform differently from the market as a whole and other types of stocks and can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.\\nCommodity-Linked Investing.  The value of commodities and commodity-linked investments may be affected by the performance of the overall commodities markets as well as weather, political, tax, and other regulatory and market developments. Commodity-linked investments may be more volatile and less liquid than the underlying commodity, instruments, or measures.\\nAn investment in the fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. You could lose money by investing in the fund.\\n\\nPerformance\\n\\nThe following information is intended to help you understand the risks of investing in the fund.

A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the Fund\\u2019s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund\\u2019s portfolio turnover rate was 26% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\\n\\nIvy Mid Cap Growth Fund seeks to achieve its objective by investing primarily in common stocks of mid-capitalization companies that IICO believes are high quality and/or offer above-average growth potential. Under normal circumstances, the Fund invests at least 80% of its net assets in the securities of mid-capitalization companies, which, for purposes of this Fund, typically are companies with market capitalizations within the range of companies in the Russell Midcap Growth Index at the time of acquisition. As of June 30, 2018 (the quarter-end closest to the index\\u2019s rebalance), this range of market capitalizations was between approximately $2.44 billion and $35.58 billion.\\n\\nIn selecting securities for the Fund, IICO primarily emphasizes a bottom-up (researching individual issuers) approach and focuses on companies it believes have the potential for strong growth, increasing profitability, stable and sustainable revenue and earnings streams, attractive valuations and sound capital structures. IICO may look at a number of factors in its consideration of a company, such as: new or innovative products or services; adaptive or creative management; strong financial and operational capabilities to sustain multi-year growth; stable and consistent revenue, earnings, and cash flow; strong balance sheet; market potential; and profit potential. Part of IICO\\u2019s investment process also includes a review of the macroeconomic environment, with a focus on factors such as interest rates, inflation, consumer confidence and corporate spending.\\n\\nGenerally, in determining whether to sell a security, IICO considers many factors, including what it believes to be excessive valuation given company growth prospects, deterioration of fundamentals, weak cash flow to support shareholder returns, and unexpected and poorly explained management changes. IICO also may sell a security to reduce the Fund\\u2019s holding in that security, to take advantage of what it believes are more attractive investment opportunities or to raise cash.\\n\\n \\n\\n20\\t \\tProspectus\\t \\tDomestic Equity Funds\\nTable of Contents\\nPrincipal Investment Risks\\n\\nAs with any mutual fund, the value of the Fund\\u2019s shares will change, and you could lose money on your investment. The Fund is not intended as a complete investment program. A variety of factors can affect the investment performance of the Fund and prevent it from achieving its objective. These include:\\n\\n \\n\\n\\u220e\\t \\tCompany Risk. A company may be more volatile or perform worse than the overall market due to specific factors, such as adverse changes to its business or investor perceptions about the company.\\n \\n\\n\\u220e\\t \\tGrowth Stock Risk. Prices of growth stocks may be more sensitive to changes in current or expected earnings than the prices of other stocks. Growth stocks may be more volatile or not perform as well as value stocks or the stock market in general.\\n \\n\\n\\u220e\\t \\tInformation Technology Sector Risk. Investment risks associated with investing in the information technology sector, in addition to other risks, include the intense competition to which information technology companies may be subject; the dramatic and often unpredictable changes in growth rates and competition for qualified personnel among information technology companies; effects on profitability from being heavily dependent on patent and intellectual property rights and the loss or impairment of those rights; obsolescence of existing technology; general economic conditions; and government regulation.\\n \\n\\n\\u220e\\t \\tManagement Risk. Fund performance is primarily dependent on IICO\\u2019s skill in evaluating and managing the Fund\\u2019s portfolio. There can be no guarantee that its decisions will produce the desired results, and the Fund may not perform as well as other similar mutual funds.\\n \\n\\n\\u220e\\t \\tMarket Risk. Markets can be volatile, and the Fund\\u2019s holdings can decline in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market or economic developments or conditions that may cause a broad market decline. Different parts of the market, including different sectors and different types of securities, can react differently to these developments. Since the financial crisis that started in 2008, the U.S. and many foreign economies continue to experience its after-effects, which have resulted, and may continue to result, in volatility in the financial markets, both U.S. and foreign. Global economies and financial markets are becoming increasingly interconnected, which increases the possibilities that conditions in one country or region may adversely affect issuers in another country or region, which in turn may adversely affect securities held by the Fund. These circumstances also have decreased liquidity in some markets and may continue to do so. In addition, certain events, such as natural disasters, terrorist attacks, war, and other geopolitical events, have led, and may in the future lead, to increased short-term market volatility and may have adverse long-term effects on world economies and markets generally.\\n \\n\\n\\u220e\\t \\tMid Size Company Risk. Securities of mid-capitalization companies may be more vulnerable to adverse developments than those of larger companies due to such companies\\u2019 limited product lines, limited markets and financial resources and dependence upon a relatively small management group. Securities of mid-capitalization companies may be more volatile and less liquid than the securities of larger companies, and may be affected to a greater extent than other types of securities by the underperformance of a sector or during market downturns.\\n \\n\\n\\u220e\\t \\tSector Risk. At times, the Fund may have a significant portion of its assets invested in securities of companies conducting business in a broadly related group of industries within an economic sector. Individual sectors may be more volatile, and may perform differently, than the broader market. Companies in the same economic sector may be similarly affected by economic or market events, making the Fund more vulnerable to unfavorable developments in that economic sector than funds that invest more broadly.\\nPerformance\\n\\nThe chart and table below provide some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund. The chart shows how performance has varied from year to year for Class A shares. The table shows the average annual total returns for each Class of the Fund and also compares the Fund\\u2019s returns with those of a broad-based securities market index and a Lipper and Morningstar peer group (each a universe of mutual funds with investment objectives similar to that of the Fund). The chart does not reflect any sales charges and, if those sales charges were included, returns would be less than those shown. Unlike the returns in the chart, the returns in the table reflect the maximum applicable sales charges for the Fund.\\n\\nAfter-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual Federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on an investor\\u2019s tax situation and may differ from those shown. After-tax returns are not relevant to investors who hold their Fund shares through tax-deferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts (IRAs), or to shares held by non-taxable entities. After-tax returns are shown only for Class A shares. After-tax returns for other Classes may vary.\\n\\nPerformance results include the effect of expense reduction arrangements for some or all of the periods shown. If those arrangements had not been in place, the performance results for those periods would have been lower.\\n\\nThe Fund\\u2019s past performance (before and after taxes) does not necessarily indicate how it will perform in the future. Current performance may be lower or higher.

The Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in Institutional Class, I-2, Class A or Class C shares of the Fund with the costs of investing in other mutual funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the noted class of shares for the time periods indicated, and then redeem all your shares at the end of those periods. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the same.

A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example tables, affect the Fund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was [ ]% of the average value of its portfolio.\\n\\n\\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\\n\\n\\nThe Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing under normal circumstances at least 80% of its assets in debt securities whose interest is, in the opinion of bond counsel for the issuer at the time of issuance, exempt from regular federal income tax and California income tax (\\\"California Municipal Bonds\\\"). California Municipal Bonds generally are issued by or on behalf of the State of California and its political subdivisions, financing authorities and their agencies. The Fund may invest in debt securities of an issuer located outside of California whose interest is, in the opinion of bond counsel for the issuer at the time of issuance, exempt from regular federal income tax and California income tax. By concentrating its investments in California, the Fund will be subject to California State-Specific Risk.\\n\\n\\nThe Fund may invest without limitation in \\\"private activity\\\" bonds whose interest is a tax-preference item for purposes of the federal alternative minimum tax (\\\"AMT\\\"). For shareholders subject to the AMT, a substantial portion of the Fund's distributions may not be exempt from federal income tax. The Fund may invest 25% or more of its total assets in debt securities whose interest is, in the opinion of bond counsel for the issuer at the time of issuance, exempt from federal income tax (\\\"Municipal Bonds\\\") that finance education, health care, housing, transportation, utilities and other similar projects, and 25% or more of its total assets in industrial development bonds. The Fund may invest the remainder of its net assets in other types of Fixed Income Instruments. \\\"Fixed Income Instruments\\\" include bonds, debt securities and other similar instruments issued by various U.S. and non-U.S. public- or private-sector entities. The average portfolio duration of this Fund normally varies within (negative) 2 years to positive 4 years of the portfolio duration of the securities comprising the Bloomberg Barclays California Intermediate Municipal Bond Index, as calculated by Pacific Investment Management Company LLC (\\\"PIMCO\\\"), which as of [ ] was [ ] years. Duration is a measure used to determine the sensitivity of a security's price to changes in interest rates. The longer a security's duration, the more sensitive it will be to changes in interest rates. The portfolio manager focuses on bonds with the potential to offer attractive current income, typically looking for bonds that can provide consistently attractive current yields or that are trading at competitive market prices. Capital appreciation, if any, generally arises from decreases in\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPIMCO FUNDS | PROSPECTUS\\n\\n1\\n\\n \\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\nPIMCO California Intermediate Municipal Bond Fund\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ninterest rates or improving credit fundamentals for a particular state, municipality or issuer.\\n\\nThe Fund invests primarily in investment grade debt securities, but may invest up to 10% of its total assets in high yield securities (\\\"junk bonds\\\"), as rated by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (\\\"Moody's\\\"), Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (\\\"S&P\\\") or Fitch, Inc. (\\\"Fitch\\\"), or, if unrated, as determined by PIMCO.\\n\\n\\nThe Fund may invest in derivative instruments, such as options, futures contracts or swap agreements, or in mortgage- or asset-backed securities. The Fund may purchase or sell securities on a when-issued, delayed delivery or forward commitment basis and may engage in short sales. The Fund may also invest in securities issued by entities, such as trusts, whose underlying assets are municipal bonds, including, without limitation, residual interest bonds. The Fund may, without limitation, seek to obtain market exposure to the securities in which it primarily invests by entering into a series of purchase and sale contracts or by using other investment techniques (such as buy backs or dollar rolls). The Fund may also invest up to 10% of its total assets in preferred securities.\\n\\n\\nPrincipal Risks\\n\\n\\nIt is possible to lose money on an investment in the Fund. The principal risks of investing in the Fund, which could adversely affect its net asset value, yield and total return are listed below.\\n\\n\\n\\nInterest Rate Risk: the risk that fixed income securities will decline in value because of an increase in interest rates; a fund with a longer average portfolio duration will be more sensitive to changes in interest rates than a fund with a shorter average portfolio duration\\n\\n\\n\\nCall Risk: the risk that an issuer may exercise its right to redeem a fixed income security earlier than expected (a call). Issuers may call outstanding securities prior to their maturity for a number of reasons (e.g., declining interest rates, changes in credit spreads and improvements in the issuer's credit quality). If an issuer calls a security that the Fund has invested in, the Fund may not recoup the full amount of its initial investment and may be forced to reinvest in lower-yielding securities, securities with greater credit risks or securities with other, less favorable features\\n\\n\\n\\nCredit Risk: the risk that the Fund could lose money if the issuer or guarantor of a fixed income security, or the counterparty to a derivative contract, is unable or unwilling to meet its financial obligations\\n\\n\\n\\nHigh Yield Risk: the risk that high yield securities and unrated securities of similar credit quality (commonly known as \\\"junk bonds\\\") are subject to greater levels of credit, call and liquidity risks. High yield securities are considered primarily speculative with respect to the issuer's continuing ability to make principal and interest payments, and may be more volatile than higher-rated securities of similar maturity\\n\\n\\n\\nMarket Risk: the risk that the value of securities owned by the Fund may go up or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably, due to factors affecting securities markets generally or particular industries\\n\\n\\n\\nIssuer Risk: the risk that the value of a security may decline for a reason directly related to the issuer, such as management performance, financial leverage and reduced demand for the issuer's goods or services\\n\\n\\n\\nLiquidity Risk: the risk that a particular investment may be difficult to purchase or sell and that the Fund may be unable to sell illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price or achieve its desired level of exposure to a certain sector. Liquidity risk may result from the lack of an active market, reduced number and capacity of traditional market participants to make a market in fixed income securities, and may be magnified in a rising interest rate environment or other circumstances where investor redemptions from fixed income mutual funds may be higher than normal, causing increased supply in the market due to selling activity\\n\\n\\n\\nDerivatives Risk: the risk of investing in derivative instruments (such as futures, swaps and structured securities), including leverage, liquidity, interest rate, market, credit and management risks, mispricing or valuation complexity. Changes in the value of the derivative may not correlate perfectly with, and may be more sensitive to market events than, the underlying asset, rate or index, and the Fund could lose more than the initial amount invested. The Fund's use of derivatives may result in losses to the Fund, a reduction in the Fund's returns and/or increased volatility. Over-the-counter (\\\"OTC\\\") derivatives are also subject to the risk that a counterparty to the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligations to the other party, as many of the protections afforded to centrally-cleared derivative transactions might not be available for OTC derivatives. For derivatives traded on an exchange or through a central counterparty, credit risk resides with the Fund's clearing broker, or the clearinghouse itself, rather than with a counterparty in an OTC derivative transaction. Changes in regulation relating to a mutual fund's use of derivatives and related instruments could potentially limit or impact the Fund's ability to invest in derivatives, limit the Fund's ability to employ certain strategies that use derivatives and/or adversely affect the value of derivatives and the Fund's performance\\n\\n\\n\\nEquity Risk: the risk that the value of equity securities, such as common stocks and preferred securities, may decline due to general market conditions which are not specifically related to a particular company or to factors affecting a particular industry or industries. Equity securities generally have greater price volatility than fixed income securities\\n\\n\\n\\nMortgage-Related and Other Asset-Backed Securities Risk: the risks of investing in mortgage-related and other asset-backed securities, including interest rate risk, extension risk, prepayment risk and credit risk\\n\\n\\n\\nLeveraging Risk: the risk that certain transactions of the Fund, such as reverse repurchase agreements, loans of portfolio securities, and the use of when-issued, delayed delivery or forward commitment transactions, or derivative instruments, may give rise to leverage, magnifying gains and losses and causing the Fund to be more volatile than if it had not been leveraged. This means that leverage entails a heightened risk of loss\\n\\n\\n\\nManagement Risk: the risk that the investment techniques and risk analyses applied by PIMCO will not produce the desired results and that legislative, regulatory, or tax restrictions, policies or developments may affect the investment techniques available to PIMCO and the individual portfolio manager in connection with managing the Fund. There is no guarantee that the investment objective of the Fund will be achieved\\n\\n \\n\\n2     \\n\\nPROSPECTUS | PIMCO FUNDS     \\n\\n \\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProspectus\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMunicipal Bond Risk: the risk that a Fund may be affected significantly by the economic, regulatory or political developments affecting the ability of issuers of Municipal Bonds to pay interest or repay principal\\n\\n\\n\\nCalifornia State-Specific Risk: the risk that by concentrating its investments in California Municipal Bonds, the Fund may be affected significantly by economic, regulatory or political developments affecting the ability of California issuers to pay interest or repay principal\\n\\n\\n\\nMunicipal Project-Specific Risk: the risk that the Fund may be more sensitive to adverse economic, business or political developments if it invests a substantial portion of its assets in the bonds of similar projects (such as those relating to education, health care, housing, transportation, and utilities), industrial development bonds, or in bonds from issuers in a single state\\n\\n\\n\\nShort Exposure Risk: the risk of entering into short sales, including the potential loss of more money than the actual cost of the investment, and the risk that the third party to the short sale will not fulfill its contractual obligations, causing a loss to the Fund\\n\\n\\n\\nPlease see \\\"Description of Principal Risks\\\" in the Fund's prospectus for a more detailed description of the risks of investing in the Fund.

The information provides some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by showing changes in its performance from year to year and by showing how the Fund's average annual returns compare with the returns of a broad-based securities market index and an index of similar funds. Absent any applicable fee waivers and/or expense limitations performance would have been lower. The bar chart shows performance of the Fund's Institutional Class shares. For periods prior to the inception date of I-2 shares (April 30, 2008) and Class C shares (August 31, 2009), performance information shown in the table for these classes is based on the performance of the Fund's Institutional Class shares, adjusted to reflect the actual distribution and/or service (12b-1) fees and other expenses paid by these classes of shares. Performance for Class A and Class C shares in the Average Annual Total Returns table reflects the impact of sales charges. The Fund's past performance, before and after taxes, is not necessarily an indication of how the Fund will perform in the future.\\n\\n\\nThe Bloomberg Barclays California Intermediate Municipal Bond Index is an unmanaged index comprised of California Municipal Bond Issues having maturities of at least five years and less than ten years and consists of a broad selection of investment-grade general obligation and revenue bonds of maturities ranging from one year to 30 years. The index is made up of all investment grade municipal bonds issued after 12/31/90 having a remaining maturity of at least one year.
